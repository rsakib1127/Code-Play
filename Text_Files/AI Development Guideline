In our research group, we study foundational market design questions from an algorithmic and game-theoretic perspective. Current group members work on a variety of projects including machine learning-based combinatorial auctions, data markets, cloud computing markets, financial markets, and equilibrium finding algorithms.

Most of our projects are funded by the ERC and the Swiss National Science Foundation. We have an international network of collaborators, including at companies such as Google and Microsoft. We publish in the top conferences and journals in AI and Economics and Computation.
