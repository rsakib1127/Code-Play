I am currently into blockchain and web development. Also, work as a database schema designer and DevOps. I provide Git solutions too. I can set up CI/CD pipeline. 
I always push myself to complete the task as fast as possible but also not compromise with the quality of that product. Client satisfaction is the main motto of my service.
