Final docker-compose.yml should:

- mount host machine VOLUME, where all AVDs located. AVDs are already created and stored on host machine.
- start Appium server
- start Android Emulator with one of the AVDs
- start my ruby script that will connect to Appium and automate some actions

* emulator in docker will need KVM

As a result, I want to run docker-compose with one parameter - AVD name.
